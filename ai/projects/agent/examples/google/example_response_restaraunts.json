While parking in the area can be pricey ($8/hour!), a quick 7-8 minute walk northeast leads to free street parking and gives you a chance to explore the neighborhood.\n\nThe food was fantastic! I started with the Hog Island oysters, which were incredibly fresh and bursting with flavor, without a hint of fishiness. Next, I tried the garlic grilled oysters, cooked to perfection - juicy, creamy, and infused with garlicky goodness. The old bay fries were another highlight - crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and seasoned with a hint of sweetness. Even the ketchup impressed me - tangy and refreshing, it complemented the fries perfectly.\n\nThe clam chowder wasn't your typical version. Instead of small bits, it showcased plump whole clams in a slightly thinner, yet still creamy broth that avoided being overly milky.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable dining experience. Plus, considering the high quality of the food, the prices were very reasonable. This hidden gem, even amidst the tourist crowds, offers excellent value and deserves a visit!",

The clam chowder had a lighter soup to it while the mussels had a thicker stronger taste. Both were wiped out with the bread. The oysters were super fresh. Perfect. I would definitely recommend this place and come back again. There will be a line to queue in. But it was worth it as we were then seated at the table facing Bay Bridge and not facing the queue. It was such a good lunch. In total we spent about usd100 each. There were two of us. If you had more people the cost would be lower.",

Every dish that was served brought us closer to food heaven, making every second we spent there an unforgettable experience.\n\nTo kick off our culinary journey, we indulged in the mouth-watering Moroccan Cigars - a flavor explosion of lamb, mushrooms, gruyère, and cinnamon, paired with a tantalizing tamarind-mint chutney. And let's not forget the Barcha Spreads - a magnificent medley of baba ghanoush, labneh, muhammara, hummus, and bazlama that danced on our tongues.\n\nFor our main courses, the Persian Tahdig was the true star of the show, with its crispy saffron rice, duck leg, onions, barberries, fried egg, harissa yogurt, and herbs. The combination of crispy rice, juicy duck, and crispy onions was a symphony of flavors that left us weak in the knees. And the lamb shank leg with couscous was an absolute knockout, with tender meat that simply melted in our mouths.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, we were served the divine Affogato - vanilla soft serve, and espresso, were delicious, and the Chocolate Cake was a sweet ending that left us wanting more.\n\nAlthough the lighting kept adjusting during our time there dim to bright and keep going from our stayed from 6 pm - to 8 pm, it was hard on our eyes.\n\nAll in all, Barcha Mediterranean Restaurant offers more than just a meal - it is a journey through the Mediterranean region's culinary delights. Every dish served was a masterpiece, and the warm welcome made us feel like we were part of the family.",

A lot of things ordered were for the table to share, starting off with the mini wagyu burgers, truffle fries and the jalapeno pickled shrimp cocktail. Everything was delicious, the burgers were cooked to perfection, the fries were indeed truffle served with a great sauce and the jalapeno pickled shrimp cocktail was outstanding. For dinner we all ordered our own entrees but the sides were for the table to share, with entrees we ordered crispy brussel sprouts and lobster mac n cheese. The sides were fabulous and large enough to share between the four of us. I had the surf and turf for my entree which consist of a 6 oz filet and a lobster tail. The steak was perfectly cooked with the truffle butter on top and then they torch it in front of you, the lobster legitimately fell apart in your mouth it was so good. We had quite a few cocktails and a glass of wine, the strawberry cobbler cocktail was the highlight. The service was excellent, the food was a 10/10. The music is a bit weird/loud and the decor/horns on the wall are kinda weird BUT the food and service and the rest of the decor was amazing! We can’t wait to come back.",

Has an old school, proper vibe to the place yet fresh with the mix of modern and retro design features. The staff was all over us ensuring we were cared for and each one offered more than the basics like insight on a drink or menu item. The food was fantastic with a nod to Northern Italy. Fresh ingredients that seemed to all come straight from the farmer’s market. While they were happy to modify most of the dishes to be vegetarian, they do need to focus on adding more vegetarian options that are on the menu. With more intention will bring more wow factor.",
