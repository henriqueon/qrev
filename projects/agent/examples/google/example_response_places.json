My previous dentists were all nice enough (well, except for one...) but there was always something missing, whether it be thoroughness, execution of services, personnel, care, etc. I'm hopeful that Dr. Puno will be my forever dentist because she is the best of the best!\n\nA friend of mine recommended Dr. Puno to me after I complained about my previous dental appointments. It's a huge bonus that she is located in One Embarcadero Center, since that's only two blocks away from my office. This makes it really easy and convenient for me to see her, whereas before I really had to move my schedule around to go across town. They also validate for parking, another plus!\n\nIt was super easy to set up an appointment as a new patient. With a few emails exchanged, I had my new patient consultation and cleaning appointment set up, and also received the forms to fill out prior to arriving at the office. This saves precious time and it's surprising how many other dentists don't offer this.\n\nUpon arrival at their office, it's really clean and modern looking. It suits the Embarcadero Center aesthetic. Since I visited during the pandemic, they were very thorough and checked my temperature and did a screening questionnaire. Additionally, you sanitize your hands and the bottom of your shoes. I also appreciated that they have plenty of air purifiers in plain sight. Good ventilation/air circulation is a huge factor in the spread of COVID-19, and it was really reassuring to see that they took this seriously. I've been anxious to go grocery shopping (let alone the dentist) but the office really made me feel at ease and completely safe.\n\nThis was probably the best dental cleaning I ever had. My teeth are now stain-free, and feel so nice and smooth. I've had cleanings before where I left and my teeth still felt gritty/dirty, which is a terrible feeling. Dr. Puno also noticed right away that I had previously extracted several teeth. This is not a major factor, but it shows her awareness and attention to detail, which I really appreciated. I also liked that I was able to ask her plenty of questions and voice any concerns I had, and she would take her time to assess and explain to me the why/how/what/when of it all. She did not pressure me for any procedures, but simply gave me the facts and her educated opinions, and let me decide for myself. For example, I have a crevice in my back molar that tends to get stained and attract food particles. Many dentists would probably suggest to seal or fill it, however Dr. Puno said that since I seem to practice good oral hygiene, that we could leave it be and continue to monitor it and reassess at a later time if it gets borderline serious. I remember I had asked one of my previous dentists whether or not I should remove my wisdom teeth, and he literally said \"I don't know, up to you if you feel like it.\" You never want to hear something like that from a licensed professional in charge of your health and well being!\n\nI left their office with a fresh smile and a newly instilled confidence in my dentist. For once, I actually find myself looking forward to my next dental appointment! If any of my friends or family need dental recommendations, I will definitely suggest Dr. Puno.",

I was a patient at two other dental practices before transferring to here.  Never felt like they tried to sell me on any treatments.  I was advised on issue and future concerns but they never pushed the treatment.  They only explained the problem, cause of the problem, the solution and alternatives.\n2.  The ortho treatment is impressive.  My 10 year old daughter is currently on their ortho treatment and a few days after her braces came on, I saw results.  (Pictures attached.  We had to remove the top wire because my daughter complained about it too much) It was impressive, very impressive.  I and my two younger children will be going on this treatment as well.\n3.  The staff is friendly and pleasant.  Makes the visits comfortable and enjoyable.\n4.  They are technologically above par!  Compared to the other two dental offices I've been at, they can pretty much do everything in house.  Crowns, implants, etc.  I spoke with other people who had ortho treatments before and the measures that Dr Puno provides is unheard of to most.  Don't know what the gizmo is called, but that machine was impressive.  It measures and analyzes your bite, jaw line, nerve tissues, etc.  (Picture attached)  Two thumbs up here.\n5.  They really stepped up when reopening the office during this pandemic.  WOWZA!  They do the typical questions and temperature reading prior to you entering the office.  Normal stuff.  Then you step on two pads to clean the bottom of your shoes.  That's thorough.  Then you sanitize your hands.  Usual procedure.  But the WOWZA part if the airflow.  Every corners and rooms has a Dyson air filtering fan and then in the middle of the office is a hospital grade air purifying system!  That is beyond expectation.  It feels super clean and safety is a top priority.  The little snake plants that purifies air is a cute plus.\n\nI highly recommend this practice.  They're very busy but that's because they provide wonderful services.",

I was a patient at two other dental practices before transferring to here.  Never felt like they tried to sell me on any treatments.  I was advised on issue and future concerns but they never pushed the treatment.  They only explained the problem, cause of the problem, the solution and alternatives.\n2.  The ortho treatment is impressive.  My 10 year old daughter is currently on their ortho treatment and a few days after her braces came on, I saw results.  (Pictures attached.  We had to remove the top wire because my daughter complained about it too much) It was impressive, very impressive.  I and my two younger children will be going on this treatment as well.\n3.  The staff is friendly and pleasant.  Makes the visits comfortable and enjoyable.\n4.  They are technologically above par!  Compared to the other two dental offices I've been at, they can pretty much do everything in house.  Crowns, implants, etc.  I spoke with other people who had ortho treatments before and the measures that Dr Puno provides is unheard of to most.  Don't know what the gizmo is called, but that machine was impressive.  It measures and analyzes your bite, jaw line, nerve tissues, etc.  (Picture attached)  Two thumbs up here.\n5.  They really stepped up when reopening the office during this pandemic.  WOWZA!  They do the typical questions and temperature reading prior to you entering the office.  Normal stuff.  Then you step on two pads to clean the bottom of your shoes.  That's thorough.  Then you sanitize your hands.  Usual procedure.  But the WOWZA part if the airflow.  Every corners and rooms has a Dyson air filtering fan and then in the middle of the office is a hospital grade air purifying system!  That is beyond expectation.  It feels super clean and safety is a top priority.  The little snake plants that purifies air is a cute plus.\n\nI highly recommend this practice.  They're very busy but that's because they provide wonderful services.",
